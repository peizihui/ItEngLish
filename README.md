 Let's learn english  !!!



`English is very important for programmers. English learning is also a process of accumulation. Every time when you meet a new word for the first time, record it.Those who are interested can join us.`



 English 对程序猿及其重要，英语的学习也是个积累的过程，每次在第一次遇见陌生单词的时候，记录下，常见的单词就那么多，不积跬步，无以至千里！有兴趣的可以一起参与。
