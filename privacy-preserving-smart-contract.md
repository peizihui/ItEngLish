But that versatility masks one of its most powerful tools. 

但这种通用性掩盖了它的一种最强大的工具。

Versatility is another of your strong points, but don't overdo it by having too many irons in the fire. 

你还有一个长处是多才多艺， 但不要揽事太多而太露锋芒。

《新英汉大辞典》

Its versatility, flexibility, and wide range of implementations and environments make it difficult to describe procedures to cover all cases. 

其通用性、灵活性以及广泛的实现和环境，使得描述能涵盖所有情况的过程非常困难。

Secret contracts are written in Rust and compile into Web Assembly (WASM) bytecode. WASM gives Enigma network the versatility to address use cases like regression and machine learning that are not possible with EVM. Rust is an excellent programming language that simultaneously optimizes for both safety and performance.
